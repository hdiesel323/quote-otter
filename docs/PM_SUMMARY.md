- 46+ service categories
- Template system ready to scale
- Call Now feature implemented

### **Quick Math (Conservative):**

**Month 1 (Soft Launch):**
```
10 providers × $200/month subscription = $2,000 MRR
+
50 leads/day × $10 per lead × 30 days = $15,000
= $17,000 total revenue
```

**Month 3 (Growing):**
```
50 providers × $200/month = $10,000 MRR
+
200 leads/day × $10 per lead × 30 days = $60,000
= $70,000 total revenue
```

**Month 6 (Scale):**
```
100 providers × $200/month = $20,000 MRR
+
500 leads/day × $10 per lead × 30 days = $150,000
= $170,000 total revenue
